# Parallel-Image-Processing
Parallel implementation of applying a convolution kernel to an image and essentially blurring it.

This project consists of 3 portions. The first portion is a simple serial program that applies a convolution kernel to an image. We chose the kernel in a way that we would achieve blurring. The code is attatched. The results of the program is shown below.
